# Luna
Luna is a local restaurant guide, where users are able to search for restaurants based on location, rating, or categories as well as write reviews for restaurants which they have recently visted.
Users are also able to list their own restaurants.

## Stack:
The frontend is built using React.js, Redux and Styled Components
The Backend is built using Python, Django Rest Framework and PostgreSQL
Docker, Docker-compose, Gitlab CI/CD and Nginx.

#### The frontend is still not 100% completed, as the user profile page is still under construction!
